Description
***********

gridman is the general mesh library. It reads mesh and
assigns element and element faces and boundary information.
Cell.cpp has routines to compute quadrature based integrals
for terms from the weak form. 

Solver contains the main solver files. It is currently rigged
to solve the inviscid Burger's equation. The inviscidflux function
can be modified to do the Euler equations as well.

How to run
*********

Go to obj folder and invoke make.
move the exe file to the test folder

Go to test folder, and do ./euler.exe
The inputs-DG sets polynomial order and time steps etc.

The output files are written unstructured vtu format. It
can be read by paraview. The initial and final.dat files
are extracted along the center line. It contains 6 columns.
First column is the coordinate and 2-6 are the conserved
variable values. To plot solution on gnuplot, use
gnuplot> plot 'initial.dat' u 1:2 w l,'final.dat' u 1:2 w l
